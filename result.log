See the following links for a portfolio: http://picheta.me/projects.html and/or https://github.com/dom96.Email: dominikpicheta@gmail.comI am one of the main developers of the Nim programming language having contributed to the core language by improving the compiler and the standard library. I have written all of the asynchronous IO, sockets and many other related modules in Nim\'s standard library, as such I am very skilled in the low-level details of Posix and Windows systems.I have also developed a lot of software projects, most of which are open source and available on my Github. These include a package manager for the Nim programming language, a web framework inspired by Sinatra, the Nim forum (http://forum.nim-lang.org), IRC libraries in Haskell, Python and Nim, an IDE using the GTK+ framework and many more.I am currently looking for both remote and UK opportunities for internships this summer.

I\'m not a cowboy coder: I feel that development is about solving problems, and code is how you happen to express the solution. The fact that it has to run on a computer is completely besides the point.I like to learn new things, and when left to my devices I usually master them pretty quickly. To illustrate: when diving into C# for the first time, at my previous job, I went straight from "what are indexed properties?" to "hey, look, expression trees!"; from a relative newcomer to C#/.NET I went to the local language expert in around a year. When playing around with Python I went for metaclasses straight away (they\'re fun!).I like to work on the module-surpassing problems in a large application. I like to solve the large issues keeping back development; I like to think about making development easier for my colleagues. I like progress, I like changing things for the better.

I focus on building low-maintenance and dependable solutions. Even though I enjoy exploring the technological bleeding-edge (I aggressively enhance my toolbox with new languages, technologies, and libraries whenever possible), I often choose more well-tested and mature solutions especially under time and resource constraints.My interests include service-oriented architectures, programming languages, and distributed systems. Last year, I reached a 365-day consecutive streak of commits to GitHub (still going at 624 consecutive commits). I wrote about my experience: http://polybits.net/2014/08/16/365-days-of-github/.My open-source work includes a RESTful content-addressable storage server, a proxy for local and remote filesystems, a LINQ-inspired shell, an event-driven performance monitor, a Rust client for beanstalkd, two libraries in Erlang and Go for writing an AI bot for Vindinium, and numerous contributions to Rust and its auxiliary libraries.\n                      \n                      -----\n                  \n      \n      ',
